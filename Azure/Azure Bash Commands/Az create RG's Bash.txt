To create a resource group in the same Azure region as the az104-03c-rg1 resource group you created in the previous lab, from the Bash session within Cloud Shell, run the following:

sh
LOCATION=$(az group show --name 'az104-03c-rg1' --query location --out tsv)

RGNAME='az104-03d-rg1'

az group create --name $RGNAME --location $LOCATION
To retrieve properties of the newly created resource group, run the following:

sh
az group show --name $RGNAME
To create a new managed disk with the same characteristics as those you created in the previous labs of this module, from the Bash session within Cloud Shell, run the following:

sh
DISKNAME='az104-03d-disk1'

az disk create \
--resource-group $RGNAME \
--name $DISKNAME \
--sku 'Standard_LRS' \
--size-gb 32
When using multi-line syntax, ensure that each line ends with back-slash (\) with no trailing spaces and that there are no leading spaces at the beginning of each line.

To retrieve properties of the newly created disk, run the following:

sh
az disk show --resource-group $RGNAME --name $DISKNAME
Task 3: Configure the managed disk by using Azure CLI
In this task, you will managing configuration of the Azure managed disk by using Azure CLI session within Cloud Shell.

To increase the size of the Azure managed disk to 64 GB, from the Bash session within Cloud Shell, run the following:

sh
az disk update --resource-group $RGNAME --name $DISKNAME --size-gb 64
To verify that the change took effect, run the following:

sh
az disk show --resource-group $RGNAME --name $DISKNAME --query diskSizeGb
To change the disk performance SKU to Premium_LRS, from the Bash session within Cloud Shell, run the following:

sh
az disk update --resource-group $RGNAME --name $DISKNAME --sku 'Premium_LRS'
To verify that the change took effect, run the following:

sh
az disk show --resource-group $RGNAME --name $DISKNAME --query sku
Clean up resources
[!note] Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

[!note] Don't worry if the lab resources cannot be immediately removed. Sometimes resources have dependencies and take a long time to delete. It is a common Administrator task to monitor resource usage, so just periodically review your resources in the Portal to see how the cleanup is going.

In the Azure portal, open the Bash shell session within the Cloud Shell pane.

List all resource groups created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

sh
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az104-03')].name" --output tsv
Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

sh
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az104-03')].[name]" --output tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'az group delete --name $0 --no-wait --yes'
The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the --nowait parameter), so while you will be able to run another Azure CLI command immediately afterwards within the same Bash session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

Review
In this lab, you have:

Started a Bash session in Azure Cloud Shell
Created a resource group and an Azure managed disk by using Azure CLI
Configured the managed disk by using Azure CLI
